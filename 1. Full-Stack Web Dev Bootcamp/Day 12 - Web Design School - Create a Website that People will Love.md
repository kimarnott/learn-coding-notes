>[!question] Yellow - bright, and eye-catching 
>Don't use as a main colour as it can be overwhelming

>[!success] Green - freshness, growth, safety

>[!note] Blue - trust, stability, serenity

>[!example] Purple - royalty, wealth, femininity

## Typography:

> [!tip]+ Match mood to audience
> - **Sans-serif** - sensible, simple, straightforward
> - **Serif** - traditional, stable, respectable
> - **Script** - personal, creative, elegant
> - **Display** - friendly, loud, amusing
> - **Modern** - stylish, chic, smart

Don't choose more than 3 fonts for your webpage, otherwise it'll look very cluttered and confused, but do try to switch between serif and sans-serif. Keep the mood the same across all your font choices.
 
>[!failure] DO NOT USE
>Comic Sans; Kristen; Papyrus; Viner; Curlz; or (some Greek letter one that I can't read)

## UI Design
Think about what you want your users to see first, second, third etc.. Take advantages of sizing, layouts, and colours to draw the eye.

For line widths: aim for 40-60 characters per line.

Reducing the number of alignment points makes your website use more professional, and easier to make sense of.

Make sure to make use of white space, don't make your content too dense (e.g. luxury shops space out their products loads compared to bargain stores, so lots of space makes things look more expensive). Minimalist designs often look better (think apple).

## UX Design
Design your website to make the user's experience in navigating/using it so easy that they don't even notice it (intuitive). Good UX is invisible, bad UX causes rage.
1. Simplicity - don't overwhelm people with a massive, bland, block of content
2. Consistency - keep things like nav bars the same
3. Reading patterns - most common is 'F' pattern, keep most important parts on the LHS (or 'Z' pattern for more sparsely populated sites)
4. All platform design - mobile responsive (want design to look good on small and large screens).
5. Don't be evil - don't trick/frustrate people into doing things they didn't want to (dark patterns)
