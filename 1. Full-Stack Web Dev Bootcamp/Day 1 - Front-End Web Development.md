# General

Client: Computer (browser) requesting information
ISP: Internet service provider
DNS: Domain name system (like a phone book)
Server: Serves up the IP address for whatever you're looking for, returning HTML, CSS, and JS files.

HTML: content
CSS: styling
JS: functionality 

Browsers specialise in dealing with these files. You are looking at your local version of these files, any edits that you make in the developer tools are not saved in the server (hitting refresh redelivers the files from the server).

*Aria* text is for text readers.
