Werkzeug is a comprehensive [[WSGI]] web application library. It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.

Werkzeug doesnâ€™t enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle requests.

```dataview
TABLE without id file.inlinks as "Where is this used?"
WHERE file.name = this.file.name
SORT file.inlinks.order ASC 
```
