A small and simple integration of Gravatar into [[Flask]].

Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) is a service that allows users to create a profile linked to their email addresses. These profiles are used across millions of sites, providing a consistent avatar and user identity. As a developer, you can leverage Gravatarâ€™s APIs to access these profiles and personalize their experience without the hassle of managing user profile data.

```dataview
TABLE without id file.inlinks as "Where is this used?"
WHERE file.name = this.file.name
SORT file.inlinks.order ASC 
```
