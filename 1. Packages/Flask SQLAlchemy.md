Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for [[Flask]] that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your application. It simplifies using SQLAlchemy with Flask by setting up common objects and patterns for using those objects, such as a session tied to each web request, models, and engines.

Flask-SQLAlchemy does not change how SQLAlchemy works or is used. 

```dataview
TABLE without id file.inlinks as "Where is this used?"
WHERE file.name = this.file.name
SORT file.inlinks.order ASC 
```
