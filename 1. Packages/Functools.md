[Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html)

The `functools` module is for higher-order functions: functions that act on or return other functions. In general, any callable object can be treated as a function for the purposes of this module.


```dataview
TABLE without id file.inlinks as "Where is this used?"
WHERE file.name = this.file.name
SORT file.inlinks.order ASC 
```
